# DataSprints

In this project, I have a big dataset with many features related to properties located in Curitiba. In this project, I have a big dataset with many features related to properties located in Curitiba. The point of this study, as any other data science project, is founding value in a big amount of data.

The Jupyter Notebook was split in 4 Topics. If you just want to see the Analysis (Topic4), remember to download the file base_final.csv and the Mapa_Curitiba.png. 

1) Importing all frameworks we are using in analysis

2) Importing Dataset

3) Transforming our Dataset

3.1) Columns Source

3.2) Removing Null and Duplicated Values

3.3) Cutting Outliers

3.4) Adding Columns

4) Data Analysis (Storytelling)

4.1) Properties Types

4.2) Rent or Purchase

4.3) Residences Location

4.4) Discrete Variable (N° of rooms, N° bathrooms, etc)

4.5) Boolean Variable (Entertainmentand Security)

4.6) Continuous Variable

I used the technique Drilldown for explain my analysis. This make more sense for me because it is unfair to compare variables with different attributes. I should let you know that unfortunately the codes takes 1 hour to run it all. So maybe it is a good idea to run the code and go watch one episode series on NetFlix while the Jupyter is working.
